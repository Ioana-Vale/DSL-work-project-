During my internship, I was involved in the development of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for the JavaScript programming language using Xtext. 
The main activities carried out included designing, implementing, and testing the DSL, providing advanced features such as code auto-completion and syntax validation.
In the first stage, I defined the DSL grammars specific to JavaScript in Xtext, ensuring they accurately reflected the required syntax and structure. 
This process included configuring syntax and semantic rules to adapt the DSL to JavaScript language requirements.

After defining the grammar, I implemented code completion and scoping functionalities. 
These features allow users to write code more efficiently and navigate quickly between different language elements, providing real-time suggestions and completions.

Next, I developed complex validations to verify the correctness and consistency of the code written in the DSL. 
These validations were essential for identifying and preventing errors, ensuring that all files comply with the defined rules and constraints.

To guarantee the proper functioning of the DSL, I performed unit tests using JUnit. T
he tests covered various aspects of the DSL, including syntax, code completion, scoping, and validation, contributing to the stability and reliability of the developed tool.
